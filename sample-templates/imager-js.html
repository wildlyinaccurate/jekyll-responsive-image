Render your responsive images using Imager.js (https://github.com/BBC-News/Imager.js/), with the smallest resized image used as a fallback.

Usage:

	{% responsive_image path: assets/image.jpg alt: "A description of the image" %}

(P.S. You can safely delete this comment block)

{% assign smallest = resized | sort: 'width' | first %}

<div class="responsive-image">
    <img class="responsive-image__placeholder" src="/{{ smallest.path }}">
    <div class="responsive-image__delayed" data-src="/assets/resized/{width}/{{ original.basename }}"></div>
</div>

<script>
new Imager('.responsive-image__delayed', {
    availableWidths: [{{ resized | map: 'width' | join: ', ' }}],
    onImagesReplaced: function() {
        $('.responsive-image__placeholder').hide()
    }
})
</script>
